	<h1>EPQ</h1>
	<p>EPQ {Extended Project Qualification} is a 5000 word written report on a subject of your own choice.</p>
	<p>I decided, as I couldn't take psychology as an A-level, I chose to do my EPQ on the Nature vs Nurture debate on Murderers.</p>
	<p>I am not mainly focused on what they have done, as I am more interested in how they have grown up, and if it has shaped them into the person they are today.</p>
