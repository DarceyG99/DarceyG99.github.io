	<h1>EPQ</h1>
	<p>EPQ {Extended Project Qualification} is a 5000 word written report on a subject of your own choice.</p>
	<p>I decided, as I couldn't take psychology as an A-level, I chose to do my EPQ on the Nature vs Nurture debate on Murderers.</p>
	<p>I am not mainly focused on what they have done, as I am more interested in how they have grown up, and if it has shaped them into the person they are today.</p>

			<td align="center">Research is an important aspect of the EPQ. This is because you have to find out all the information on the topic that you would like to write about. It is essential that you crosscheck all of your information, as not all of it will be credible and legitamate. Using different types of resources such as books, documentaries, professionals as well as the internet, will allow you to broaden your research. </td>

			<td align="center">EPQ requires a lot of deterimation and thinking. You have to persevere even if you are struggling to find information about a certain topic, and possibly think of other ways to find outabout it. For example, don't just rely on the internet, by going to a library or speaking to a professional will hopefull open up doors to finding out the information that you need.</td>
