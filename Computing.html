	<h1>Computing</h1>
	<p>Out of all four of my subjects, Computing is by far my favourite. It is the subject that I want to continue on at University. I have a love of programming and I enjoy being able to solve any problems that I face.</p>
	<p>It pushes me to learn more about the subject and help me enjoy applying what I know to creating things such as this website.</p>
	<p>As you already will know, Computing as an A-Level is made up of two parts, the programming side and the theory side.</p>
	<p>As of yet, I have no started my NEA {Non-Exam Assessment} But I am looking to start planning it over the next few weeks.</p>
